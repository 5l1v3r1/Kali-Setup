# OS-Scripts

This script was originally written by g0tmi1k (https://github.com/g0tmi1k/os-scripts).  I do not claim credit for the basis of the script! That said, I have added a lot more tools and fixed a lot of error with the original version. I maintain this and keep it updated to how I like it.

Re-wrote it in python as kali.py, but its not completely bug-free yet
